AI Assistant Troubleshooting Guide

COMMON ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS:

1. MODEL NOT FOUND ERRORS:
   - Download required GGUF model for chat mode
   - YOLOv8 model downloads automatically
   - Check model paths in configuration
   - Verify file permissions

2. CAMERA ISSUES:
   - Enable camera interface: sudo raspi-config
   - Check camera connection
   - Try USB camera as fallback
   - Verify camera permissions

3. HIGH MEMORY USAGE:
   - Reduce model context size (n_ctx)
   - Use smaller YOLO model (yolov8n)
   - Close other applications
   - Increase swap space

4. HIGH TEMPERATURE:
   - Improve cooling (heat sink, fan)
   - Reduce CPU threads
   - Lower camera resolution
   - Monitor with vcgencmd measure_temp

5. SLOW PERFORMANCE:
   - Use quantized models (Q4_0, Q4_1)
   - Reduce context size
   - Lower camera FPS
   - Check system resources

6. IMPORT ERRORS:
   - Install missing dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
   - Check Python version (3.11+)
   - Verify virtual environment activation

7. CHROMADB ISSUES:
   - Check disk space
   - Verify write permissions
   - Reset knowledge base if corrupted

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
- Use SSD instead of microSD for better I/O
- Allocate more RAM to GPU (128MB+)
- Use cooling solutions for sustained workloads
- Monitor system resources regularly
